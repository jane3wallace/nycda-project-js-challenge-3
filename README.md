# NYCDA WD JavaScript Challenge #3
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly after Week 7 Lecture 1. This project was a JavaScript kata.

### Assignment:
Create a form on a Web page where a user can enter a number. When the user submits the form, it should show the number on the page below the form like this:
```
Your number is 7
```
<br>
Start with this pseudocode:

HTML:<br>
`Add some text that says "enter your favorite number"`<br>
`Create a form in HTML with an input` <br>
`Add a submit button` <br>
`Add an empty HTML element to hold the favorite number` <br>

JavaScript:<br>
`Add a click event handler to the submit button` <br>
`Get the value out of the html input` <br>
`Set the HTML of the empty HTML element that holds the favorite number to the value of the html input`
